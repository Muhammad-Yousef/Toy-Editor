# Toy-Editor

Actually, I was having some free time while I was at work, so I decided to have some fun with Python and Tkinter to create that TITAN text editor instead of doing nothing :D

# Features

This GIGANTIC text editor can do the following:

1. Create new file.
2. Open an exisiting file.
3. Save file.

#### Note: Quit will be added in version 2.0, stay tuned or go using Vim instead (If you know what I mean XD)
